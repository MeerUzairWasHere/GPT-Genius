# GPT-Genius

Due to the pricing constraints associated with integrating the OpenAI API, I regret to inform you that the development of GPT-Genius has been halted. As a learner without the financial means to sustain the costs, I had to make the difficult decision to discontinue this promising project.

# üí° Project Overview:
GPT-Genius aimed to leverage the power of OpenAI's advanced language model to create a platform that promotes learning and knowledge sharing. The project sought to provide users with a tool capable of generating intelligent and contextually relevant responses for a variety of applications.

# ‚ùóÔ∏è Why the Discontinuation?
Unfortunately, the OpenAI API comes with a financial commitment that exceeds my current budget as a learner. Despite my enthusiasm for the project, I am unable to continue its development without the necessary resources.

# üÜò How You Can Help:
